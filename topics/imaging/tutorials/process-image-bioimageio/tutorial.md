Deep learning models are increasingly used in bioimage analysis to perform processing steps such as segmentation, classification, and restoration tasks (e.g., {% cite Moen2019 %}). The [BioImage.IO](https://bioimage.io/#/) platform ({% cite Wei2021 %}) provides a standardized way to share and discover pre-trained models, making them accessible across tools and platforms.

Each model in BioImage.IO is tailored for a specific biological task — for example, segmenting nuclei, detecting mitochondria, or identifying neuronal structures — and trained on specific imaging modalities such as electron or fluorescence microscopy (e.g., {% cite vonChamier2021 %}, {% cite GomezdeMariscal2021 %}).

This tutorial will guide you through the process of applying one of these BioImage.IO models to an input image using Galaxy ({% cite Afgan2018 %}). You will learn how to upload and configure the model, set the correct input parameters, and interpret the output files.

⚠️ As of the `tool version 2.4.1+galaxy1`, only the following 11 PyTorch-based BioImage.IO models are compatible with the Galaxy tool *“Process image using a BioImage.IO model with PyTorch”*:

## Model-specific example

This example illustrates the type of information that is both useful for understanding the model’s biological context and necessary for using the Galaxy tool — specifically, the input axes and input size parameters.

🧬 NucleiSegmentationBoundaryModel

This model segments nuclei in fluorescence microscopy images. It predicts <em>boundary maps</em> and <em>foreground probabilities</em> for nucleus segmentation, primarily in images stained with DAPI. The outputs are designed to be post-processed with methods such as Multicut or Watershed to achieve instance-level segmentation (object-based segmentation).

- **Imaging modality**: Fluorescence microscopy  
- **Task**: Nucleus segmentation (boundary-aware)  
- **Input axes**: `bcyx`  
- **Input size**: `256,256,1,1`  
- **Model link**: [View on BioImage.IO](https://bioimage.io/#/r/ilastik/stardist_dsb_training_data)

The model will process the input image and generate two outputs:
- A predicted image (`.tif`)
- A predicted tensor matrix (`.npy`)

Below is an example of the tiff output from the **🧬 NucleiSegmentationBoundaryModel:**

> 4. How can you interpret the output of the model, and what does it tell you about your input image?
>
> > <solution-title></solution-title>
> >
> > 1. Because deep learning models are trained on specific image shapes and dimensions; mismatches will cause errors or wrong results.
> > 2. The model will fail to run or produce invalid output.
> > 3. **TIFF (.tif)** is a standard format for storing image data, commonly used in microscopy and bioimaging. It can be easily viewed and interpreted visually.  
> >    **NPY (.npy)** is a binary format used by NumPy to store arrays. In this case, it contains the raw prediction tensor produced by the model, which can be useful for further analysis or visualization with Python tools.
> > 4. The model generates a **predicted image** that highlights or segments specific structures (e.g. nuclei, cells, mitochondria) based on what it learned during training. By comparing the output image to the input, users can see which regions were detected or classified, helping to extract biological meaning from the raw data.

> Galaxy provides a basic preview using its `.tif` viewer tool. However, BioImage.IO models often produce **multi-dimensional TIFF stacks** (e.g. 3D volumes, multi-channel images), which are not fully rendered in Galaxy's preview.
>
> To properly explore the results, it is recommended to **download the TIFF file** and open it locally using image analysis tools such as **Fiji/ImageJ**, **napari**, or **QuPath**.

# Conclusion

In this tutorial, you learned how to run a BioImage.IO model on a biological image using Galaxy. By uploading a compatible model and image, setting the appropriate size and axes, and running the tool, you obtained both a predicted image and a tensor matrix representing the model output.

This provides a fast, reproducible way to apply deep learning models in the context of bioimage analysis — all within Galaxy.
